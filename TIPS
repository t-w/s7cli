Tips concerning usage of s7cli                                   -*- text -*-
------------------------------

Using SIMATIC (and its API...) can be very tricky.
Below are some tips regarding issues that may occur.

* Projects / libraries can be specified using their name or path.
  Be careful using only names because it might be not unique!
  The same project opened from different directories  may exist
  under the same name(!) on SIMATIC list of projects. s7cli
  will open the first available on the list (warning to implement...).

* To open an existing project with s7cli it has to be "registered"
  in SIMATIC (already opened at least once).
  To archieve it using only s7cli it is necessary to:
  - use 'createProject' command first to create a new, empty project
  - copy the existing project to overwrite files in the directory
    with the project created with s7cli
  Then it can be used with s7cli (specifying the name or path).

* Name programs inside single project (esp. with several PLC inside) 
  in a way they can be _easily_ identified, ie. give unique name for 
  each program within a single Step7 project (at least do it for each 
  program which you need to use with the tool)

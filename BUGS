----------------------------

* importation and copying (block and sources) seems much slower than 
using GUI; not critical as machines are wasting time not us, but it
could be fixed (if possible - for the moment reason unknown...)

* program _is not_ prepared for any possible input arguments that
can be provided, please do not expect useful error information for 
any possible case (it has improved but for the moment no time to do 
more)

* importation of hardware configuration (importConfig) _always_ creates
a new station; moreover - it does not accept all types of configuration file
(as does the same function selected from SIMATIC's menu), 
i.e. FILEVERSION "3.2" does not seem supported by the library

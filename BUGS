Known problems/bugs in s7cli                                     -*- text -*-
----------------------------

* importation and copying (block and sources) seems much slower than 
using GUI; not critical as machines are wasting time not us, but it
could be fixed (if possible - for the moment reason unknown...)

* program _is not_ prepared for any possible input arguments that
can be provided, please do not expect useful error information for 
any possible case (it has improved but for the moment no time to do 
more)

* importation of hardware configuration (importConfig) _always_ creates
a new station; moreover - it does not accept all types of configuration file
(as does the same function selected from SIMATIC's menu), 
i.e. FILEVERSION "3.2" does not seem supported by the library

* Projects / libraries can be specified using their name or path.
  The same project opened from different directories  may exist
  under the same name(!) on SIMATIC list of projects. s7cli
  will open the first available on the list (a warning to implement...).

* The importLibBlocks command may copy blocks from an incorrect S7 program(!)
  when using the Step7 libraries with multiple S7 programs.
  For the moment the only 100% sure override is using libraries with only
  one S7 program inside (what usually is the case anyway, but be aware...).

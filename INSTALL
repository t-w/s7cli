Installation
============

   The compiled binary bin/s7cli.exe is a standalone program, it can be 
executed from any place. For easy access, it can be placed eg. in one of the
directories included in the Windows system PATH.

   The s7cli (obviously) requires the Siemens SIMATIC Step 7 installed.

   The program was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 as a 32bit Windows
executable. It was tested and used on 64bit versions of Windows 7 and 
Windows Server 2008 with:
  - STEP 7 Professional SR4, V5.5 + SP4
  - SIMATIC S7-SCL Professional 2010 SR4, V5.3 + SP6 + Upd2

It was briefly tested (importing sources and compiling) using a newer version: 
  - Step7 Professional 2017 V5.6 + HF1
  - SIMATIC S7-SCL Professional 2017 V5.6 + HF1


Building from sources
=====================
   Compiling the program from sources may require similar environment
as described above (ie. Microsoft Visual Studio, probably at least the same
version). The project does not require any special configurations, rebuilding
it should be straightforward.

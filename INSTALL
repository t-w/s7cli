Basic Installation
==================

   The pre-compiled binary in bin/ directory can be used just used as-is, 
executed from any place. It can be put to some directory in Windows 
system PATH for easy access.

   For use the s7cli (obviously) requires the Siemens SIMATIC Step 7 installed.

   The program was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as 32bit Windows
executable, was tested and used on 64bit versions of Windows 7 and 
Windows Server 2008 with:
  - Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 Professional SR4, V5.5 + SP4
  - S7-SCL Professional 2010 SR4, V5.3 + SP6 + Upd2

   Building from sources - may require similar environment as described
above (ie. Microsoft Visual Studio, probably at least the same version).
Building the project does not require any special configurations, should
be straightforward.

Installation
============

   The compiled binary bin/s7cli.exe is a standalone program, it can be
executed from any place. For easy access, it can be placed eg. in one of the
directories included in the Windows system PATH.

   The s7cli (obviously) requires the Siemens SIMATIC Step 7 installed.

   It was tested and used on:

   - Windows 2010, Windows Server 2008, 2016 and 2019 with the Siemens PLC
     software development environment:
     - Step7 Professional 2017 V5.6 + HF1
     - SIMATIC S7-SCL Professional 2017 V5.6 + HF1

   - Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 (64bit versions) with:
     - STEP 7 Professional SR4, V5.5 + SP4
     - SIMATIC S7-SCL Professional 2010 SR4, V5.3 + SP6 + Upd2


Building from sources
=====================

   The program was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

   Compiling the program from sources would require similar environment
as described above (ie. Microsoft Visual Studio and Siemens SIMATIC Step7,
probably both at least the same version as above).
   The project does not require any special configurations, building it
should be straightforward.
